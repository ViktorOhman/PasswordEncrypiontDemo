This is how to use this tiny demo.

You begin By running PasswordSet. There you follow all the steps that the program tells you to.
Now you can run PasswordCheck or PasswordLook.
PasswordCheck is a way to test if you remember your password.
PasswordLook is a way to see you password.

For quick context if you are looking att the code, a file with [GenericVariableName]_E, means that that variable is Encrypted or will be.
And a file with [GenericVariableName]_F means File or FileContense.
A variable with [GenericVariableName]_C means Confirm.
Finally a variable with I_[GenericVariableName] mean Input.
