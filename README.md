# PasswordEncryptDemo
This is my first Github project. I have been learning Pytohn for a little while now and I wanted to put my skills to the test. So I made this tiny project about encrypting and decryping passwords. WARNING! It should not be used for profesionall or even personal use. It's not secure!. This was a project about messing around and not anythig else.
