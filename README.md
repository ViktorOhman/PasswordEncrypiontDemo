# PasswordEncryptDemo
This is my first Github project. I have been learning Python for a little while now and I wanted to put my skills to the test. So I made this tiny project about encrypting and decrypting passwords. WARNING! It should not be used for professional or even personal use. It's not secure! This was a project about messing around and not anything else.
